# How Have Countries Performed in the IMO Over the Past 30 Years?

This project analyzes data from the **International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)**, using the dataset published as part of **TidyTuesday (September 2024)**.

The dataset spans **1959 to 2024** and provides comprehensive coverage of both **individual** and **team-level** competition outcomes. It includes detailed information such as:
- Individual participant scores
- Individual rankings
- Medal results
- Team-level medal counts and performance summaries

The breadth of this historical data enables meaningful exploration of long-term performance trends, comparative analysis across countries, and insights into how national performance has evolved over time.

In this report, we develop a series of data visualizations and use them to guide our analysis in addressing the following research questions:
- Which countries have performed exceptionally well over the last 30 years, based on country ranking and gold medals?
- Which countries show strong potential to achieve higher scores and win more medals in the future?
- How do problem difficulty levels help differentiate the capabilities of the top-performing and high-potential countries?
